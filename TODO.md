`link_lengths`:

* Could save space by omitting `time` and `htl` on all but the first entry of a given `id`.

`store_size`:

* Correct terminology errors - the datastore contains the store and the cache.

* Consistently use and specify UTC.
* Clean up analyze by breaking into functions instead of a serial script. Perhaps a frontend and backend module?
