# For example, to log at INFO instead of the default WARNING, uncomment the following:

#verbosity=INFO

[DEFAULT]
#
# Number of probe sessions. This should be set to approximately the minimum
# sustained number of peers expected. If OVERLOAD errors are common it is an
# indication that this value is too high. This default works well with a 25-peer
# limit.

#
# Seconds to wait before timing out on a probe request.
# The node has a local timeout for requests which is based on the hops to live.
# This does not interfere with sending additional requests.
# As of this writing, there is a base timeout of 15 seconds, and every HTL over
# 1 adds 3 seconds,
#
# For the default HTL of 25, this means the local node has an 87-second timeout.
# Increasing this to account for possible delay in the timeout firing and to
# make it a round number results in a 95-second timeout.

# Comma-separated list of types. Every time a probe is sent its type is randomly

# Result types are documented in more detail in src/freenet/node/probe/Type.java

# Multiple occurances of the same type are considered separately, so to send
# both BANDWIDTH and UPTIME_48H with BANDWIDTH more often one could use
# "BANDWIDTH,BANDWIDTH,UPTIME_48H".
