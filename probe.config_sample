# Seconds to wait before timing out on a probe request.
# The node has a local timeout for requests which is based on the hops to live.
# This does not interfere with sending additional requests.
# As of this writing, there is a base timeout of 15 seconds, and every HTL over
# 1 adds 3 seconds,
#
# For the default HTL of 25, this means the local node has an 87-second timeout.
# Increasing this to account for possible delay in the timeout firing and to
# make it a round number results in a 95-second timeout.

# Result types are documented in more detail in src/freenet/node/probe/Type.java
